# Traffic Violations Analysis using Apache Spark

Analyzing traffic violations data using Apache Spark's MLlib. 

To be able to run **App.scala**; <br>
1- Create a folder called **"data"**. <br> 
2- Download the dataset from following link : https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/traffic-violations-56dda <br> 
3- Move the dataset into the "data" folder you created. <br> 


Traffic Violation Analysis using Apache Spark, is the project that I chose for **CS450 : Distributed System and Cloud Computing** 
course in Özyeğin University.
